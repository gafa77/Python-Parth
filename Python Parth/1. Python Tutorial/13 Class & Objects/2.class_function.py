# The __init__() Function

#The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.
#To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
#All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
#Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

# Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.



# The __str__() Function
#The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.
#If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1)


class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"    

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1)
