# Variable Names

"""
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
2. A variable name cannot start with a number
3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
5. A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

# Multi Words Variable Names

#Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
#There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:



# Camel Case

#Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "John"



# Pascal Case

#Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "John"



# Snake Case

#Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "John"
