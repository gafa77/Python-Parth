# Variables

#Variables are containers for storing data values.

# Creating Variables

#Python has no command for declaring a variable.
#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

x = 5         # x is of type int
y = "John"    # x is now of type str

print(x)
print(y)
print(type(x))
print(type(y))



# Casting

#If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

a = 4
A = "Sally"

print(a)
print(A)
#A will not overwrite a it is a case-sensitive.
