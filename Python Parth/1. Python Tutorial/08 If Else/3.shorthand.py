# Shorthand

# Short Hand If

#If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.


#One line if statement:
a = 200
b = 33

if a > b: print("a is greater than b")



# Short Hand If ... Else

#If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:


#One line if else statement:
a = 2
b = 330

print("A") if a > b else print("B")
